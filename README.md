A sketchpad to draw graphs.

## Motivation

Final project for my graph theory course.

## Features
- Able to draw, delete, and move nodes.
- Draw edges between nodes and delete edges.
- Display number of edges, components, degree of each node, and if the graph is bipartite.
- Recolor nodes and recolor to show bipartite graph if graph is bipartite.
